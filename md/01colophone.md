*For my parents and my children.*

Trine Bjørkman Berry has given us a rich and illuminating narrative of the communities, aesthetics and technologies of videoblogging before YouTube - revealing it to be a site of mundane expression, cultural innovation and social hope. At a moment when the digital media imagination seems to have been captured by corporate behemoths, we need more stories like this. 

Jean Burgess, Professor of Digital Media and Director of Digital Media Research Centre, Queensland University of Technology, Australia. 

Trine Bjørkmann Berry's compellingly written and highly original study of the historically located and embodied, medium-specific and cultural-technical practices of the early-adopter video blogging community eloquently fills a significant gap in previous studies of online video. Through her painstaking ethnographic, historical, aesthetic and media-archeological research she successfully argues that, in order to maintain critical understandings of the media practices and theories we observe around us today, it is essential to remember and understand the media practices of the past, even or perhaps especially those that led to ‘dead-ends’ and ‘failed’ media forms. This is an essential study that will change the ways in which we think about past, present and future online creative communities and digital platforms.

Catherine Grant Professor of Digital Media and Screen Studies, Birkbeck, University of London.



Bjørkmann Berry’s sharp, timely and endlessly fascinating book explodes a common assumption that the world of YouTube celebrities, online memes and ‘haul videos’ is horribly banal and ephemeral. At its heart is a revealing ethnographic analysis of the practices of videobloggers. This is an ambitious, richly-layered and resonant study: alive to broader aesthetic, technical, political, and cultural questions, it reveals the complexities and significance of online video cultures more generally. By charting the emergence of these media ‘hybrids’ and immersing us in their fast-mutating subcultures, Bjørkmann Berry forces us to look well beyond the obvious example of YouTube - and requires us to think afresh about the ‘newness’ of all so-called ‘new media’. Such historical sensibility is a rare commodity and should make her Videoblogging Before YouTube vital reading for anyone with an interest in contemporary media.

David Hendy, Professor of Media and Cultural History, University of Sussex.

This critical history of the present, and disruptive intervention into the progress narratives of new media technologies, is crucial reading for anyone in media studies. Trine Bjørkmann Berry’s Videoblogging Before Youtube is a fascinating, in depth and meticulous cultural history of an important moment in the history of digital media. It examines the use of video in its vernacular, everyday and experimental formats in a moment of transition. The book brings together richly ethnographic material in relation to media practices of videoblogging and interrogates this authoritatively and beautifully, in relation to film and digital media theory. It shows us the value of thinking about media futures in relation to their histories, and the moments of practice, disruption and appropriation that are so important in understanding the current media landscape.

Kate O’Riordan, Professor of Digital Culture, University of Sussex, UK.








>The film of tomorrow appears to me as even more personal than an
individual and autobiographical novel, like a confession, or a diary.
The young filmmakers will express themselves in the first person and
will relate what has happened to them. It may be the story of their
first love or their most recent; of their political awakening; the story
of a trip, a sickness, their military service, their marriage, their
last vacation...and it will be enjoyable because it will be true and
new… The film of tomorrow will resemble the person who made it, and the
number of spectators will be proportional to the number of friends the
director has. The film of tomorrow will be an act of love.

– Francois Truffaut, 1957.

Writing a book is never a solo expedition; it enrols other people, some
voluntary, some through need and others by accident. This book reflects
a project that has been running since 2005, and owes a debt of gratitude
to many generous, inspiring and thoughtful friends, associates and
networks who by good fortune I was able to meet, bounce ideas off,
discuss and argue with along the way. During the course of this research
I had to manage the pressures of my own everyday life experiences from
pregnancy to relocation, from sickness to health. To all who made time
for me I would like to give my deepest thanks.

Specifically, I would like to thank Geert Lovink for his generous help,
support and patience while I finished the final drafts of this book. I
would also like to thank him for pushing me to write this book in the
first place; to Miriam Rasch and everyone else at the Institute for
Network Cultures for all the help and support along the way; to my
copyeditors, Rosie Underwood and David M. Berry; to Marcus Leis Allion
for designing the diagram in chapter 4. A number of people have helped
me in a number of ways at different stages of writing this book and in
particular I would like to mention Arne Andreassen, Nils August
Andresen, Thomas Austin, Caroline Bassett, Sarah Baumber, Matthew
Beetar, David M. Berry, Rikke Bjørkmann, Tullen Bjørkmann, Michael Bull,
Jean Burgess, Hanne Castberg Tresselt, Cécile Chevalier, Gemma Cobb,
Amelia Culliford, Soraya Cotwald-Ray, Anders Fagerjord, M. Beatrice
Fazi, Natalie Flynn, David Gauntlet, Alison Gibb, Claudia Ginsburg,
Catherine Grant, Lucy Haynes, Hegel, David Hendy, Tanya Kant, Raquel
Leis Allion, Tine Levin Granlund, Adrian Miles, Gemma Quinton-Moulds,
Caroline Nikiforov-Clarke, The Pelham Arms, Jane Perry, Kate O’Riordan,
Elizabeth Reed, Laura Reynolds, Sara Russet, Hedda Rønnevig, Shirley
Tang, Rachel Tavenor, Daniela Tepe and Cecilia Virlombier. I would also
like to thank Dr Adam MacDermaid-Gordon and everyone at the Royal Sussex
County Hospital for looking after me. I would also like to thank the
wonderful institution that is the British NHS.

This book would not be possible without the very generous members of the
videoblogging community, who not only welcomed me into their lives when
I signed up for the videoblogging email list in August 2005, but who
have helpfully shared their insight and experiences with me over the
course of many years. In particular I would like to thank Richard BF,
Cheryl Colan, Roxanne Darling, Jay Dedman, Loiez Deniel, Zadi Diaz, Juan
Falla, Steve Garfield, Jen Gouvea, Gena Hackett, Richard Hall, Bekah
Havens, Ryanne Hodson, Rupert Howe, David Howell, Raymond M.
Kristiansen, Daniel Liss, Casey McKinnon Jan Mcloughlin, Paris Marashi,
Mary Matthews, Erin Nealey, Erik Nelson, Gromik Nicholas, Andreas
Haugstrup Pedersen, Susan Pitman, Jennifer Proctor, Adam Quirk, Sam
Reinsew, Charlene Rule, Markus Sandy, Mica Scalin, Brittany Shoot, Enric
Teller and Michael Verdi.

Through what has been a rather tough year, my family have been patient
and understanding, and I would like to thank my husband David for being
there through all of it. Lastly, no words can describe the love and joy
I get from my three wonderful children, Helene, Henrik Isak and Hedda Emilie Davidsdatter. This is for them.
