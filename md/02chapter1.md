# 1. Situating Videoblogging 

This book is about a particular moment in media history when the
internet switched dramatically from a mostly textual medium to a fully
multimedia one. At first the revolutionary potential of this digital
transformation took place under the surface, indeed most people were
oblivious to the changes taking place. Today, we take for granted the
delivery of different media forms streaming seamlessly across the web,
just as much as we take for granted the seemingly unlimited storage
aspects for photo and video. However, back in the early 2000s standards
were weak and complicated, bandwidth was slow and erratic, and storage
was miniscule compared to today’s internet. One could say that we lived
in a different media universe, and in important respects this would be
true. Throughout this book I revisit this often forgotten world that was
pre-social media, pre-YouTube and most importantly, refreshingly amateur
in its experimentation and aesthetic. My focus is on what was known as
‘online video’ and what soon became known as *videoblogging.* I want to
demonstrate the ways in which this practice which was mostly
small-scale, self-funded and bottom-up, a truly experimental media form,
was an important predecessor to, and anticipated, our current media
ecology.

The story of online video is usually said to begin at 8:27 pm on
Saturday, April 23, 2005, when a 19 second long video clip entitled *Me
at the Zoo* was uploaded to YouTube, making it the first video published
online through the YouTube platform and shared around the world through
the website.[^02chapter1_1] This video featured a short recording of one of the
YouTube founders, Jawed Karim, on a visit to a local zoo. The video was
notable for its mundane sense of the everyday. As the New York Times
noted, ‘the video has a certain pleasing obviousness. “Here we are in
front of the, uh, elephants,” Karim says. “They have really, really,
really long” — suspense, but no double entendre — “trunks”. Karim turns
to face the elephants as if to confirm his observation. “And that’s
pretty much all there is to say.”’[^02chapter1_2] Nonetheless, as of January 2018,
the video has received over 44 million views and nearly four hundred
thousand comments from viewers.[^02chapter1_3] This video represents a key moment in
media history, however it was not the first, and perhaps not the most
important video to be posted online.

In the years since, online video has been transformed from an expensive
to distribute media-form to one which can be networked, shared,
downloaded and re-used with ease. Digital videos, a kind of ‘vernacular
avant-garde’, can now be found in a variety of short-form genres, from
family videos to haul videos (documenting things people have bought) to
unboxing videos (people opening the wrapper from their new purchases)
and from a new type of YouTube celebrity to amusing ‘meme’ videos.
Indeed, one of the most watched videos on YouTube is an amateur family
video titled *Charlie bit my finger* which has had more than 857 million
views as of January 2018. Between 2009 and 2010, it became a viral hit
and temporarily became the most viewed video on YouTube. It has since
been overtaken by a host of music videos like Psy’s *Gangham Style* (3
billion views), Wiz Khalifa’s *See You Again* (3.3 billion views) and
Luis Fonsi’s *Despacito* ( 4.6 billion views). Today, music videos
occupy at least the top 5 most viewed videos on YouTube, signaling a
shift in digital video consumption from amateur to professional, often
corporate sponsored, content. This further highlights the ways in which
the internet continues to move in a more commercial direction. Video is
now generating serious income for a number of different participants but
also, and importantly, for YouTube itself.

Rewind to 2005, however, and YouTube was losing money. Despite being
nearly exhausted by the massive costs of infrastructure, bandwidth and
storage, YouTube nonetheless grew at a furious pace from 2005 to 2006,
until it was bought by Google, a then seemingly puzzling purchase for a
search engine giant. The cost was an outrageous figure of \$1.65 billion
(£2.2 billion in 2017), which made its founders instant millionaires. By
2010 YouTube hosted more than 120 million videos and 300 million
accounts, creating new viral videos and must-watch clips daily which
would be circulated by email and other media.[^02chapter1_4] As *The* *Economist*
noted, by 2014 ‘viewers are spoiled for premium-quality choice… and
remarkably \[spend\] close to an hour watching videos online’[^02chapter1_5] per
day, in comparison to the 4.5 hours spent watching television. In 2016,
online-video advertising in the US was forecast to rise to \$10 billion,
and Forbes forecasts that the US digital marketing spend will close in
on \$120 billion by 2021. This demonstrates the prescience of Google’s
move into streaming media and highlights the way in which audiences have
adapted to online video and transformed the possibilities for its
monetization. From start-up, to incorporation into an internet giant,
this narrative about the story of digital video is the dominant way in
which we understand video becoming part of the internet.[^02chapter1_6]

In contrast, in this book I argue that one of the key moments in the
development of the practices of online video actually begins *before*
the founding of YouTube, as indeed do many of the practices and
aesthetics that YouTube’s founders made use of in their early video
work. In order to examine the often forgotten pre-history to YouTube’s
later dominance of online video, I examine the earlier moment of
community practice and video-making. In some ways my approach can be
understood as complementary to a media archaeology, in as much as it
seeks to uncover what we might call the ‘failed’ project of
videoblogging, and is certainly informed by some of the insights of that
method. Not only in seeking to uncover past technologies and old media
forms but also using such media to think about contemporary digital
culture. Indeed, I share a ‘discontent with “canonized” narratives of
media culture and history… that widely endorsed accounts of contemporary
media culture and media histories alike often tell only selected part of
the story, and not necessarily correct and relevant parts.’[^02chapter1_7] As such,
I want to add that this book is *a* history of videoblogging, and by no
means *the* history of videoblogging, just as it aims to position itself
in *a* history of some media, not *the* history of all media. It aims to
highlight the continuities and ruptures and ‘construct alternative
histories of suppressed, neglected, and forgotten media that do not
point teleologically to the present media-cultural condition as their
“perfection”.’[^02chapter1_8] Hence, this book uses non-institutionally archived
historical resources, collected as part of the project, and focuses on
different facets of online moving-image culture and its technological
conditions of possibility to present a corrective to the overly YouTube
oriented histories.[^02chapter1_9]

Nonetheless, the research materials on which this book draws form an
archive of sorts – a distributed network of texts (interviews, emails,
websites), memory (the videobloggers and others, materialised in texts
but also through the affective re-experience of the films), and a large
collection of videos. The videos are more dispersed than they were in
2005, particularly after Blip.tv, one of the main sites for hosting
videoblogs, closed its doors in November 2013, but they are still mostly
locatable, although not always straightforward to find. YouTube, which
was considered such a poor platform by the videobloggers back in 2005,
has ironically remained more stable as a site for storing, finding and
re-discovering videoblogs – some videobloggers have even retrospectively
uploaded their old films to YouTube.[^02chapter1_10]

I explore this early online video history and seek to understand it
within its historical context as a creative and experimental community
of video-makers that has been largely forgotten. The research project
itself was originally conceived of in those early days, from around
2001, when the internet was rife with the ideological promise of
creative freedom for rugged individuals (usually gendered as a man),
entrepreneurial figures soon to become dominant on the web. A
cyberlibertarian ideal, given to neoliberal ideas and venture capital
funding, was soon to be seen making money on the ‘information
superhighway’. These individuals knew how to take advantage of the wild
west of the internet as it turned into what Tim O’Reilly called Web 2.0
– using what Barbrook and Cameron had previously described as the
Californian Ideology; Information technologies are claimed to ‘empower
the individual, enhance personal freedom, and radically reduce the power
of the nation-state. Existing social, political and legal power
structures will wither away to be replaced by unfettered interactions
between autonomous individuals and their software.’[^02chapter1_11]

This was the idea of seeing the internet as a marketplace, populated by
self-actualising rational actors in a competitive free market. For
example, John Perry Barlow famously argued in his influential article *A
Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace* that cyberspace,
immaterial in form and thus a ‘civilisation of the Mind’ should not –
could not – succumb to the rules and regulations of the world of ‘flesh
and steel’.[^02chapter1_12] The notion of the rational, individual actor, an
entrepreneur, was further popularised through the work of a number of
writers, for example Eric Raymond and Lawrence Lessig.[^02chapter1_13] It became an
influential way to conceive of the political economic structures of the
internet, and as Lanier later argued, the internet ‘needs entrepreneurs
to come up with the products that are competing in the first place. In
other words, clever individuals, the heroes of the marketplace, ask the
questions which are answered by collective behaviour.’[^02chapter1_14] But of
course, in reality,

> The Net’s development was almost completely dependent on the much
> reviled American federal government…. large amounts of tax payers’
> dollars went into building the \[internet\] infrastructure and
> subsidising the cost of using its services. At the same time, many of
> the key \[internet\] programs and applications were invented either by
> hobbyists or by professionals working in their spare-time.[^02chapter1_15]

But we should also remember that the early internet was also populated
by cyborgs, cyber-goddesses, feminists and queer bodies.[^02chapter1_16] And for
others, the internet and the web offered something more than a digital
market, a place of contact, communion and community – and this is where
the videoblogging story really starts.

Indeed, videoblogging was also hugely reliant on the collective
resources that produced the internet and its technologies. It was
created through volunteerism and the contributions of videobloggers’
work towards a notion of community. Which is not to say there were not
aspects of capitalism inherent in the development of these cultural
practices and artefacts, in fact, some of the early pioneers were keen
to create standalone possible ‘products’ that might be later sold or
licensed in the creative economy. However, there remained an early
commitment to free software, open source, community-oriented values and
the excitement of building not only the technical infrastructure for
videoblogging, but also a new aesthetic and grammar of video culture.
These are the issues that fuelled videoblogging in its early days and
drive the focus in this book.

We should remember, however, that the claims of technological and
creative freedom often mask the gendered reality of an internet
political economy that favoured the already wealthy, connected, or
famous ­– indeed, the practices that emerged were sometimes less about
creative freedom, and more about power, technical skill and know-how.
The emergent practices that developed on the internet after 2000 were
reliant on existing knowledge of how the technologies worked and could
be applied, a gendered technological environment and political economy.
Although this book does not formally adopt a political economic
approach, it is clear that wealth and capital were hugely influential
and technological know-how was unevenly distributed between the
participants.[^02chapter1_17]

There are a few key issues I wish to highlight in relation to this.
These are important, and underlie and inform this work. Firstly, many of
the videobloggers I will go on to discuss self-identify as amateur. By
amateur I gesture towards the idea that one does something without
getting paid, that instead of monetary recompense, the personal
satisfaction of having created (or achieved) something is assumed to be
sufficient reward. In the digital age, the definition of being an
amateur includes being someone who pursues a passion for personal,
rather than professional, pleasure; someone who lacks either the
knowledge or means to produce professional–quality work; or someone who
labours without expecting to be paid.[^02chapter1_18] The definition of a media
amateur can also describe ‘technically interested private individuals
who acquire and develop technology before commercial use of the
technology is even recognisable’.[^02chapter1_19] In other words, being an amateur
may not be purely about doing something you love, for free, but is also
linked to the access to and knowledge of a practice and is usually
contrasted with professional work. It also refers in some sense to the
notion of the ‘early adopter’. The definition of amateur also needs to
be contextualised and historicised, and in her seminal study, Patricia
Zimmerman shows how the concept of the amateur has shifted historically.
She locates the origins of amateur film within a particular,
historically specific romanticized vision of the bourgeois nuclear
family, ‘thereby amputating its more resistant economic and political
potential for critique’. For Zimmermann, amateur film ‘occupies one of
the central contradictions of communications in the twentieth century:
on the one hand, domination and consumption; on the other, resistance
and hope’.[^02chapter1_20] This is a crucial starting point for thinking about the
interplay of amateur media forms and new digital media.

Secondly, understanding of how early adopters of videoblogging practices
engaged with the nascent technologies available to them is central to
this book. This contributes to an understanding of how their practices
developed and were conceptualised, alongside new kinds of visual tropes
and styles that emerged from their practices and experimentations.[^02chapter1_21]
New, often custom-written digital technologies and the emergence of new
forms of amateur online communication, sharing and culture, crystallised
in the practice of what they began to call videoblogging. A videoblogger
was defined as someone who produces and maintains a videoblog, and is
also likely to self-identify as a ‘videoblogger’. One of the main
distinctions drawn between someone posting videos to YouTube (here
referred to as ‘vloggers’) and a videoblogger, is that the videoblogger
maintains her own blog. This was usually individually designed, with
custom blog-rolls (or vlog-rolls), archives and about pages, where they
post videos weekly or monthly.[^02chapter1_22]

Thirdly, the terms videoblogger and videoblogging share their history
with terms such as life-casting, video-streaming, video-podcasting and
vlogging. It has become common to use the term videoblogging within
academia when referring to the practice of posting home-made videos to
video sharing sites such as Dailymotion, Vimeo or YouTube, but there are
variations of the terms in use. Adrian Miles first referred to ‘vogs’ in
his early writings and experiments with online video though he also
refers to ‘desktop video’. Lange consistently refers to ‘vlogging’ and
‘vloggers’ in her work. Burgess and Green use both ‘videoblogging’ (and
‘videobloggers’) and ‘vlogging’ (and ‘vloggers’) to describe the
practice of posting videos to YouTube, Venderbeeken refers to ‘Web
Video’, Willett to ‘moblogs’ and Treske defines ‘the time and space that
we as human beings share with ‘video’... a video sphere’*.*[^02chapter1_23] Despite
these differences, there is a certain agreement in definition of the
term(s) as videoblogging emerged as the social practice of posting
videos on an internet blog, originally a form of online journal called a
web-log. Thus, a videoblog is a blog that uses video as its main form of
expression. This definition is complicated by the emergence of vlogs on
YouTube, where vlogging would grow to include anyone posting a video of
themselves online but also encompassed other kinds of user-generated
content in video form. To distinguish between posting video on YouTube
and within the videoblogging community, and following the practice of
the videobloggers themselves, I refer to videos posted to YouTube as
vlogging and vloggers, and in the videoblogging community as
videoblogging and videobloggers.

Fourthly, videoblogging practices drew on blogging, on audio podcasting,
and the sharing of photos which had emerged on sites such as Flickr. By
the mid-2000s, the hype surrounding the concept of Web 2.0 was starting
to make its way from tech journalism and into the mainstream media, and
the ‘participatory turn’ in media was heralded as the next big
thing.[^02chapter1_24] In this fervent environment, early videobloggers sought to
create new art, documentary, film, technology and, in some cases, a hint
of micro-celebrity.

By bringing these issues together, this book contributes to our
understanding of the early practices surrounding online video production
through a cultural history. By developing a critical understanding of
how the practices developed and were used by the early adopters of
videoblogging it outlines a new cultural-technical hybrid. It outlines
an historical ethnography of the sociotechnical practices between 2004
and 2009. A running thread throughout concerns the challenges of
studying a history such as the one I am analysing here, complicated by
the fact that the empirical data is historically very recent. The book
is also a reflection on the digital present, touching, as it does on
many practices that were absorbed into ‘new’ technologies (these will no
doubt be out of date within a few years too) such as Instagram stories
and Snapchat.

I also want to challenge the claim that technology, especially internet
technology, is ‘participatory’, this is a form of technological
determinism. I want to restate that people make their own culture, but
not always in the media ecologies of their own choosing. Although it is
important to uncover the way in which hype and excitement about these
possibilities served to actually inspire individuals and collectives
seeking to build new technologies, we need to remain firmly focussed on
the way in which people make their own history, their own culture and
their own communities. By contesting fairly common descriptions of
cultural practice on the internet, and providing a cultural history that
creates dominant narratives, particularly the smooth corporate tales of
mass market success and profitability, I hope to offer an alternative
to, and corrective for, these celebratory descriptions. Today, with the
success of massive socio-technical platforms such as YouTube, Blogger
and Soundcloud, many of the smaller communities of practice across the
internet, some of which were part of creating many of the practices
around them that we now take for granted, have either been forgotten,
disbanded or co-opted into corporate platforms. This highlights the
importance of documenting these early cultural practices and
communities. For example, the upset caused by Yahoo’s decision to shut
down the social community GeoCities in 2009 led internet archivist Jason
Scoll to pose the following question: ‘is user content a right, a
treasure, a heritage, a meaningful part of the human condition?’.[^02chapter1_25]
This question also lies at the heart of this book, preoccupied as it is
with a history of a part of digital culture that is at risk of being
forgotten, and which is becoming harder and harder to uncover due to the
decisions by hosting companies to mass-delete large volumes of data from
their servers and by contemporary accounts to overstate the contribution
of corporate platforms at the expense of grassroots organising and
creativity.[^02chapter1_26]

Despite a large volume of writing on YouTube, the use of online video in
political campaigns and so forth, little has been written about the
everyday practices of vernacular online video production at the turn of
the millennium. These practitioners and artists avoided the emerging
dominant platforms of YouTube and Vimeo, indeed they offered a direct
critique to these giant aggregating systems. Videoblogging was the
result of the rapid growth in digital technologies and the relative
cheapness of new digital equipment for recording, storing and sharing
data. This increased availability of digital media technologies,
recording and editing software, networking platforms and distribution
tools ignited a flourishing of creativity amongst amateur and
semi-professional media creators, much of which converged (at the time)
under the umbrella of either ‘citizen journalism’ or ‘the creative
consumer’.[^02chapter1_27]

In 2004, a group of videobloggers came together to form a community of
practice originally based primarily around individual websites and an
email group. In subsequent chapters, I explore the contours of this
community through interviews with a group of users (33 individuals in
total, self-identified as 16 men and 17 women), and close reading of the
technologies available to, utilised by and sometimes created by them.[^02chapter1_28] I also critically engage with the discourses surrounding these
technologies and their practices and artefacts. I look at not just the
material underpinnings of the video practices, but the practices
themselves and the aesthetic these practices manifested.

Briefly, as a quick background to the book, I want to highlight the main
empirical resources that were drawn on in the development of the
argument. Firstly, I undertook semi-structured interviews to explore the
interplay between the technologies used in videoblogging as moving-image
culture, and the co-production of identity, community and critical
technical practice that developed unique short-form narratives,
aesthetics and meanings.[^02chapter1_29] Secondly, I use historical data specific to
videoblogging, such as archived email lists, articles and books (written
at and around the time by the videobloggers themselves) to develop a
critical technical and cultural understanding of how the
cultural-technical practice of videoblogging emerged and developed.
Lastly, I combine this historical material with rich ethnographic data
gathered from interviews and participant observation of the
videoblogging community, and apply this knowledge to a selection of
videoblogs to gain a deeper understanding of the aesthetic of what I
call the short-form digital film. To this end, I asked the following
questions; how did early communities of practice and related cultural
forms crystallise around digital video on the internet between
2004-2009?; why did the technical-cultural assemblage of the videoblog
emerge as a specific instance of short-form digital film, and how was
the community around this media-form sustained?; and how did the
videobloggers understand and conceptualise their own practice and the
co-construction necessary in creating the conditions of possibility for
videoblog work, sharing and community building? These questions inform
my work and act as a heuristic for the discussions in the book.

The concept of ‘community’ used here probably requires some explanation.
Benedict Anderson argued that all communities are in some sense
‘imagined’ and that throughout history various forms of communication
media have played an important role in determining the different styles
these communities have taken.[^02chapter1_30] I argue that the videoblogging
community can be understood similarly, although my meaning of community
is defined in terms of the weak ties made possible by the internet,
rather than the nation-state community that Anderson was interested in.
Similarly, in early discourses surrounding the internet, the term
‘virtual community’ – first coined by Howard Rheingold – was often
liberally applied to any group of people convening online around shared
topics of interest. It follows, therefore, that the concept of ‘virtual
community’ is open to a variety of interpretations at a variety of
moments. That technologies affect social relations is also not a new
idea. Already in 1990, Ursula Franklin announced herself ‘overawed by
the way in which technology has acted to reorder and restructure social
relations, not only affecting the relations between social groups, but
also the relations between nations and individuals’.[^02chapter1_31] The term
virtual community may seem somewhat out-dated today, as we now tend to
think of groups of people who meet and socialise online as operating
across social networks, yet to historically position videoblogging
requires the utilization of certain concepts that were used at the time,
such as ‘community’, ‘cross-post’, ‘meet-up’, and so forth. Social
networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram either did not
exist or were in a very early development in the period I am looking
at.[^02chapter1_32] Although the videoblog community did gradually migrate over to
these platforms, the early history of the community was organised in a
very different way with very different technologies.

In many ways, this book started by attempting to engage with and capture
a rapidly changing “digital present” in which new technologies were
announced glorified and abandoned on a yearly, if not monthly basis.
Many articles, papers and books published at the time shared a certain
naïve optimism about the potential of new digital technologies, seen for
instance in Jenkins exploration of participatory culture which lauded
digital technologies for their ability to bring people together and
empower them to produce and consume content in completely new ways. As
he later put it, ‘a participatory culture is one which not only lowers
the barriers to participation but also creates strong social incentives
to produce and share when one produces with others’.[^02chapter1_33] In some ways,
today we are less likely to reproduce these overly optimistic
observations, in a time when the reality of participation looks a lot
more like surveillance than freedom.

When I started planning this study in 2005, the mainstream media, as
well as media studies itself, was charged with anticipation about the
new participatory turn in online culture, as well as excitement about
‘being digital’, ‘life on the screen’, online communities, etc.[^02chapter1_34] The
promise of cheaper technologies, smoother learning curves and easier
access to both digital technologies and the internet itself, spurred an
excitement about a condition of possibility within digital culture that
would somehow aid creativity and increase participation among users.
Linked to this was the importance of digital literacy, with writers such
as Livingstone arguing that digital literacy was ‘crucial to the
democratic agenda’ because users of new media were not merely consumers,
but citizens.[^02chapter1_35]

I mention these debates because they strongly shaped the original
project that formed the basis of this book. In a sense, I am here
attempting to historicise my own experience of early videoblogging
because so many of the debates have since moved on to other questions –
notably debates around automation, surveillance and the emergent
political time-bomb that is fake news. This book, however, came out of
another almost gentler moment in digital culture, a period in which
questions of creativity, identity and community were very much at the
forefront of culture. Within this small video sub-culture on the
internet, was a relatively small group of artists and video-makers who
enthusiastically spent their time producing short digital films that
they shared with the world through their blogs. YouTube was still in its
infancy, social media did not exist and, to use a common internet meme,
Pluto was still a planet.[^02chapter1_36] And yet, this tiny community was
ambitiously trying to create a new grammar, a fresh aesthetic and a
genuinely sharing community of practice around the idea of
‘videoblogging’.

I conducted interviews with the videoblogging community in the period
between June and September 2007. Around the time, the term ‘Web 2.0’
suddenly became a hotly debated topic on the internet. Tim O’Reilly’s
paper on the social web seemed to encapsulate the very essence of what I
saw was happening in the videoblogging community. The ideas and concepts
in Web 2.0 were not so much new technological standards, as the
articulation of the web as a platform, where ‘real-time streams’[^02chapter1_37] of
live data could be accessed at any time and from anywhere via RSS and
syndication, and where the individual device from which you accessed
this data was rendered irrelevant because the software used to display
that data was ‘written above the level of a single device’.[^02chapter1_38] Web 2.0
was always a contested term, for example Trebor Scholz argues that the
ideology of Web 2.0 is merely a ‘framing device of professional elites
that define what enters the public discourse about the impact of the
Internet on society’.[^02chapter1_39] Nevertheless, its articulation still
represented an important moment for the development of the social web
and the starting point of many Web 2.0 companies, like YouTube and
Twitter. It is also an important discursive moment in the history of
videoblogging, particularly with regard to framing the practice within a
wider discourse of participatory media.

Lev Manovich goes a long way to describe the ‘emergent conventions, the
recurrent design patterns, and the key forms of new media’ [^02chapter1_40] which
he sees as the new dominant cultural form of the 21st century. Manovich
highlights numerical representation, modularity, automation, variability
and transcoding as the main principles of new media, although he is
perhaps more famous for his theorisation of the database as narrative
form. In any case, the softwarization of media, and further, the
softwarization of cultural artefacts and the rise of what has come to be
known as a digital aesthetic or digital art, has contributed to a ‘new’
typology of sorts of what constitutes a digital cultural artefact.[^02chapter1_41]
In terms of the commercial aspects and the wider questions of monetizing
the Web 2.0 technologies, and knowing the amount of free labour that
goes into the creation of both successful Web 2.0 businesses and the
plethora of not-so-successful and failed businesses, it seems pertinent
to reiterate that in this book, there are obvious political economic
considerations related to the exploitation of free labour and the
enclosure of what has been called the digital commons.[^02chapter1_42] Chanan
discusses this in relation to videoblogging where, drawing on Marx, he
conceptualises the work done by videobloggers as ‘free aesthetic
labour’.[^02chapter1_43] However, whilst this is an important critique, this book
seeks to do other work, more related to the socio-technical and cultural
unfolding of a new aesthetic-technical project. As such, and for reasons
of conceptual clarity and space, I largely bracket out the political
economic issues. This is not to say that there are not important
questions to be asked in relation to free labour and videoblogging
itself, but that the focus in this book is the material cultural
formations which relate to the condition of the web from 2004-2009[^02chapter1_44]
under which videoblogging emerged and flourished as a cultural and
material practice. This enables me to explore the way in which the
technical, the social, narrative and imaginaries surrounding
videoblogging are constructed in particular ways before the platform was
commodified and co-opted into the larger digital economy.

The theoretical framework of this book draws on emerging theories
surrounding materiality and digitalisation within the field of media
studies, particularly drawing links with German media theory and its
emphasis on the materiality of media, which makes explicit certain
characteristics in relation to undertaking a media history that I find
useful. I argue for a material understanding of the digital, seeing
videoblogs as material artefacts. Indeed, videoblogs depend entirely on
physical technology both during production, distribution and
consumption. At no point does a videoblog escape from this materiality.
Matthew Kirschenbaum’s analysis of the hard drive is a wonderful example
of thinking about materiality. Storing a video for editing requires a
hard drive. A hard drive is a non-volatile storage device made of
rotating platters with magnetic surfaces, and a video file (as with all
digital files) rests on this physical layer, without which it would not
exist. In other words, although ‘as a written trace digital inscription
\[may be\] invisible to the eye, \[…\] it is not instrumentally
undetectable or physically immaterial’.[^02chapter1_45] What this means is that,
despite having little or no technical knowledge of the underlying
structures of the computer, and particularly the hard drive, the
videoblogger depends on its materiality, and it’s stability, for her
work. The irony here, as Kirchenbaum points out, is that ‘since hard
disks, in most users’ experience, either work ﬂawlessly or else crash
spectacularly, the notion of the device as a binary black box with no
capacity for error short of global failure is perhaps inevitable. But
these functional extremes are precisely what reinforce the dominant
perception of immateriality’.[^02chapter1_46] It is also notable that exemplary as
Kirschenbaum’s forensic approach to the hard disk is, we must also note
the historical nature of hard disks, which are themselves increasingly
being replaced by a new material storage medium, namely solid-state
drives (SSD). It is ironic that the very immateriality that hard disks
made possible to experience, when looked back upon, were actually noisy
mechanical, and actually quite fragile constituent parts of a computer.
It is clear then that ‘immateriality’ is an historically constructed and
technically created form of experience in relation to the digital, much
like the dial-up modem, floppy disc or CD Roms.

Equally, the early instability of the videoblogging practice begs the
question of how to study it. Following a long tradition of scholars
questioning how to study the media,[^02chapter1_47] N. Katherine Hayles argues for
what she calls a media-specific analysis of media, an approach to
critical enquiry which acknowledges that texts are always embodied
entities and that the form of embodiment of a given text matters to its
interpretative meaning. However, like McLuhan, Hayles does not call for
media to be ‘considered in isolation from one another’, rather,
following Bolter and Grusin, she argues that ‘media constantly engage in
a recursive dynamic of imitating each other, incorporating aspects of
competing media into themselves while simultaneously flaunting the
advantages that their own forms of mediation offer’.[^02chapter1_48] This book,
then, considers videoblogging a media-specific practice, meaning that
its material and symbolic properties are both important. These
properties are in constant interplay, and can be seen to co-construct
each other. As Hayles argues, ‘in emphasizing materiality, I do not mean
to imply that all aspects of a medium’s apparatus will be equally
important. Rather, materiality should be understood as existing in
complex dynamic interplay with content, coming into focus or fading into
the background, depending on what performances the work enacts.’[^02chapter1_49] In
this sense, some aspects of the videoblogging practice may be given more
importance than others. For example, certain kinds of videoblogs require
closer attention to the embodied use of the camera to convey certain
messages, whereas others might place a stronger emphasis on narrative,
editing or effects. The aim, then, is to highlight the dynamic interplay
between the technology and the content, the medium and the performance,
through which the videoblog is constructed.

Although questions of identity and community remain crucial in
understandings digital culture, particularly with regard to a new
generation of users, it is crucial to look at the symbolic and the
material. For example, some of the early cyber-feminism literature
argued that ‘the virtual and material are intertwined and superimposed
on every aspect of cyberspace’. It is also interesting to note the
growing influence of New Materialisms, for instance in the work of Iris
van der Tuin and Rosi Braidotti.[^02chapter1_50] At universities, studying the
digital is no longer confined to a single strand within media studies,
tagged on at the end of the course, but is being adopted across the
humanities and the university more generally. Today we are faced with
‘computational media’ and ‘computational culture’.[^02chapter1_51] We might note
that Ursula Franklin argued that ‘everyone’s vernacular reality has
changed’ and that ‘there are genuinely new activities that are possible
now that could not have been done without the new technologies and their
infrastructure’. In particular, she refers to the ability of these new
technologies to more easily transfer, store and reconstruct information
and the fact that ‘some of these affect our approaches to and
perceptions of the future, that is, the projected realities’.[^02chapter1_52]

To understand this I have found Nick Couldry’s work on media as practice
very helpful for developing my conceptualisation of videoblogging as a
practice. Couldry makes it clear that he doesn’t want to reject other
forms of media research, like studies of audiences or texts, altogether.
However, he argues that by reorienting the study of media towards
practice, one is allowed to answer questions about media in ‘more
precise ways… based in the details of everyday practice and its
organisation’. To Couldry, his approach is ‘alarmingly simple; it treats
media as the open set of practices relating to, or oriented around,
media’. In other words, he aims ‘to decentre media research from the
study of media texts or production structures (important though these
are) and to redirect it onto the study of the open-ended range of
practices focused directly or indirectly on media’.[^02chapter1_53] In this book,
then, practice is defined both as the way in which the videobloggers
engage with the technologies available to them, the way in which these
ways of engaging became adopted by the community as a whole, and how a
sense of what videoblogging was became adopted as a kind of standard.

Equally, Roger Silverstone’s writing on media and everyday life has been
very influential on my own research on videoblogging. In his work on
technology and the everyday, Silverstone attempts to formulate an
approach to studying media that takes into account both the material
approaches associated with a political economic and structural side of
media production, and the symbolic content of media, i.e. audience
research, textual analysis etc. This book uses Silverstone’s argument
that media are doubly articulated as its methodological starting point.
Although referring to television, he could easily be talking about the
digital when he argues, it is ‘through its double articulation into
culture its significance is extended beyond its status “simply” as
object or medium, for in its status as medium, and through the provision
of information and entertainment, television provides the basis for an
“education”, a competence, in all aspects of contemporary culture.’[^02chapter1_54]
Silverstone’s work is situated in a long history of writings attempting
to bridge the gap between the material analysis of media and the
cultural signification of the media content. For example, Raymond
Williams argued, ‘the social history and the social analysis needed to
be directly related to critical and analytical examination of the
materials *and* processes of the specific communication’,[^02chapter1_55] in
contrast to Marshall McLuhan, who famously proclaimed that the medium is
the message, emphasising the importance of studying medium-based
analyses of media as ‘it is only too typical that the ‘content’ of any
medium blinds us to the character of the medium’.[^02chapter1_56] In his attempt to
reconcile these positions, Silverstone argues that media is not
either-or, but both material and symbolic – hence his notion of the
media as doubly articulated. This book follows in this tradition by
emphasising not just the content of videoblogs, but their materiality.
This is done in three stages; firstly, by tracing the technical
constellation around videoblogging we start to see the outline of the
videoblogging platform articulated by competing and often normative
ideas of how the platform ‘should be’ – and eventually the emergence of
a hegemonic platform imaginary. Secondly, through a formal analysis of a
number of video blogs, a particular aesthetic emerges; a medium-specific
aesthetic which is both influenced by and works in conjunction with the
technical restrictions of the platform. Finally, by conceptualising
videoblogging as a media practice, materially performed through embodied
experiences and discursively reflected upon by the participants
themselves, we see the emergence of a videoblogger identity. I now want
to turn to situating videoblogging historically in the next chapter to
broaden and deepen these discussions in terms of specific case of
videoblogs and the practices of videoblogging.

[^02chapter1_1]: The banality of the title and content pointed in some ways to
    early video on the internet was predominantly
    documentary/biographical or self-consciously aesthetic. As *The New
    York Times* observed in 2009, ‘this founding clip makes and repeats a
    larger point, too, with every pixel: Video — trivial or important —
    can now quickly and at no cost be published, broadcast and shared
    ‘Me at the Zoo’ also sets a style standard for the classic YouTube
    video: visually surprising, narratively opaque, forthrightly poetic’

[^02chapter1_9]: The lack of a historical archive is a major handicap to
    undertaking this kind of research project with early online video,
    relying in large part on the personal collection amassed by the
    researcher, and in some repositories, such the Internet Archive, or
    personal collections of the video-bloggers. A large cultural history
    has already potentially been lost due to the difficulty of
    persuading traditional archiving bodies to take internet culture
    seriously, and also to understand that it is more than a textual and
    still-image medium, requiring a complex set of technologies to be
    taken into consideration, such as the multiplicity of video codecs
    that were used for early work.

    internet were sad.  That attitude prevailed among the general
    population until Facebook blew it away.  I’d say it was much more
    prevalent in the UK than in the US.  Later when we met in person,
    Jay Dedman and I spoke about this.  I said that people in the UK
    were suspicious of technology and geeks.  He said, ‘Americans think
    that technology is the only thing that's going to save us’.

    Design Conference in Amsterdam, January 2005,
    http://art.teleportacia.org/observation/vernacular/ . It is also
    worth mentioning the Internet Archive (http://arhive.org), founded
    in 1996 by Brewster Kahle, which is one of the earliest video
    archive or storage websites for video. Kahle has been committed to
    building a full archive of the internet, storing every webpage and
    providing a history of the internet through the Way-Back Machine.
    Referred to only as ‘The Archive’, this has the potential to be
    perhaps the most lasting of all the video archiving sites. It is
    still possible to find videoblogs from this period in these
    archives. Many videobloggers used the archive to host their earliest
    videos (before the founding of Blip.tv, another video-hosting site)
    and many continued to cross-post their films there for many years,
    as a backup. However, the majority did not, which means much of the
    early videoblogging archive is already lost. Cross-posting was an
    important videoblogger practice of uploading the same video to a
    number of different repositories and hosting sites in order to
    spread the risk of one of the sites going bankrupt or merely
    disappearing without notice from the web. It was also practiced as a
    way of spreading content to wider audiences.

[^02chapter1_44]: A note on dates; I define the period of the early videoblogging
    community as falling between 2004 (when the email list was started)
    and 2009 (by which time the community had more or less disbanded).
    However, at some points in this book, I refer to earlier instances
    of video-in-a-blog, notably Kontras and Miles as significant moments
    in the history of videoblogging. These moments are included to
    highlight the difficulty of pinpointing exactly when an historical
    period begins and when it ends, and further, the importance of
    keeping an open mind about the fluidity of periods of medial change.
    It is perhaps also worth noting that although I draw on archival
    material from 2004 onwards, my initial interviews were conducted in
    2007, thus reflecting the historical specificity of that time (ie
    the videobloggers had already had a few years to reflect on their
    practices).
