    <Content>Video on the web has had a number of false starts with a variety of companies attempting to be the first to solve the delivery of online video. However, the technical issues were difficult, not only in terms of raw download bandwidth, which was miniscule in comparison with today, but also in terms of the lack of a universal video standard that could be used on the internet. The previous standards developed with physical products in mind, such as DVDs, were unsuitable, being large in size and not easily reconstituted for packet switching delivery. MPEG1 and MPEG2, for example, required the entire file to be downloaded before playback could start, and even then the file sizes tended to be gigantic. Whilst standards bodies sought to develop more suitable protocols, companies such as Apple began experimenting with a number of new formats, and the underground pirate-film networks began to gravitate towards the DivX format. But even on the ‘player’ side, users would often find that their existing software could not cope with an esoteric video codec (Code Decode video plugin) or even a strange set of video format requirements – size, scan, colours and interlace were just a few of the multiple settings on early video coding software.</Content>

    <Content>For example, on January 2nd 2000, Adam Kontras, a radio host travelling to Los Angeles from his hometown Columbus, Ohio, posted what is now widely considered to have been the first video-in-a-blog to his website. Kontras was on a mission to break into Hollywood, and for the following years chronicled his attempts to break into show business. The first video, however, was just 11 seconds of compressed footage (he had compressed it down to a remarkable 222 KB) of Kontras smuggling his cat J-Dog into a hotel (0:11min, 160x112). The video featured Kontras and his fiancée Jessica carrying their cat through a hotel lobby. Kontras continued to post these little videos almost every day throughout the year 2000. Kontras’ site (accessed today through the Internet Wayback machine), was a personal website with text and links, and thus not what I define or the videobloggers themselves define, as a ‘videoblog’, however, it was possibly the first known instance of someone linking to a video file from their website. Whether many people were actually able to view it at the time, is more difficult to ascertain. Certainly, viewing audiences would have been relatively small.</Content>

    <Content>Another example was on the 27th of November 2000, when Adrian Miles posted his first video on his blog. Miles was an academic based at RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia, where his research interests included hypertext, networked interactive video, and interactive documentary. In the winter of 2000 he was granted a fellowship in Norway and left the warm beaches of Australia for the wet and windy streets of Bergen. Miles had long been interested in the intersection of video and the digital and on this uncharacteristically sunny Wednesday morning in Bergen, he decided to give it a try himself. Miles’ video (QuickTime, 2:10, 194x144, figure 1) was accompanied by a short text, which can be seen as Miles’ first attempt to articulate his thoughts on videoblogs, or </Content>

    <Content>, as he called them, writing ‘welcome. This is a video blog. Don’t know if there are lots around, or what they should be called. But if its ok to call a web log a blog then this can be a vog’. Miles’ work is interesting because as well as being a practitioner, he was one of the first people to start theorising online video as part of his practice. A few days later, on December 6th 2000, Miles posted his first iteration of what was to be known as the ‘Vogma manifesto’. In it, Miles called for a set of principles (nine to be exact) for posting video to the internet. Over the years, Miles expanded on his manifesto, turning it into a full article, which has been widely cited.</Content>

    <Content>Miles’ definition is useful for a number of reasons. Firstly, it was one of the first attempts at theorising online video, written at a time when posting a video on the internet was incredibly difficult, hence the first rule; respecting bandwidth. It is also interesting in that it distances online video from the televisual through the rejection of streaming technologies. Thus, Miles’ definition has already defined the online video as a discrete, limited format, one which has a clearly defined beginning, middle and end, and stands alone in a potential sea of other online videos. It also sets the videoblog apart from live streaming technologies that were to flood the internet a few years later, Justin.tv being a notable example. Miles also defined the online video as ‘personal’, a definition that may have excluded a number of practitioners who considered themselves ‘videobloggers’ but who did not make inherently personal content (see for instance </Content>

    <Content>In between these early experiments, most people accepted that the combination of low bandwidth and dispersed video standards meant that online video would have to mature sufficiently before becoming useful. Despite these early instances of video-in-a-blog, the practice of videoblogging as we think of it today didn’t really begin until 2004. In a seven second long videoblog posted to his site on the first of January 2004, Steve Garfield declared 2004 ‘the year of the videoblog’.</Content>

    <Content> Garfield, a video producer and editor, had started blogging in 2000, and being convinced the internet had more to offer, he had started tinkering with video in 2002. From his home in Boston, Massachusetts, he was determined to make videoblogging the next new big thing. This was also the year Jay Dedman and Peter van Dijck got together to start the Videoblogging Yahoo Group, an email list that would act as the central hub for videoblogging activity and community, from its inception till the community more or less disbanded in 2009. Dedman and van Dijck met in 2002. Van Dijck, originally from Belgium, had relocated to New York for work and had a small place in Harlem. He and Dedman got on well, and would spend a lot of time walking around the parks of New York discussing the future of robots. They were both technically literate. Van Dijck moved to Hoboken soon afterwards, but the two stayed in touch. A couple of years later, on one of their walks, they started talking about video. Dedman, a video-editor, was working for the Manhattan Neighbourhood Network (MNN) at the time, and was getting frustrated with the community television model. They used to hang out, bounce ideas off each other and put the world to rights. After a long walk in Central Park one evening, they hit upon the idea of posting video to the internet. They both got very excited. Soon after, in May 2004, they discovered Steve Garfield’s videoblog and figured the best way to get people to work together was to create a space they could meet. Distance was an issue though, so the space would have to be virtual. On the evening of May 31st they created the videoblogging mailing list.</Content>

    <Content>The email list was an interesting choice. Not only did it connect people who lived in geographically disparate places and bring them to a shared space online in which they could communicate, it also gave them the opportunity to reach all the members by sending just one email. Slowly, the users began to treat the email list as a form of membership list. This emphasised a sense of inclusion and shared ownership of the videoblogging project. As more people joined, older members would greet new members, and the group would mostly self-regulate in terms of community behaviour and expectations. The email list also had an automatic archiving function which was important in that it gave the fledgling community a sense of how it was growing and developing shared traditions and norms.</Content>

    <Content>Peter Van Dijck posted the first message to the Yahoo videoblogging email list (hereafter referred to as ‘the email list’) on June 1st 2004. His main focus was providing technical support, but Dedman insisted that they needed a community of users. This idea of building a ‘community’ around a new technical medium product or technology was not new, of course. However, rather than being generated by a large corporation seeking to sell a product, such as Apple who actively used community-building early in their history, these individuals were first and foremost excited by the potential of new forms of expression on the internet. To Dedman, it wasn’t enough to discuss this amazing new ability to put video on the web, they needed to bring more people into the conversation. The pair were quickly joined by others, including Garfield, Adrian Miles, Anders Haugstrup Pedersen, an MA student based in Copenhagen, and Mica Scalin, an artist who saw online video as allowing the medium of web content to ‘truly come into its own and begin establishing its unique language’. It attracted her, she said, ‘because of this unique combination of traits in a visual medium. What is most interesting to me is that it provides a way to tell a story that could eliminate worn-out narrative forms.’</Content>

    <Content>The first flurry of messages on the email list was mostly technical, but there were also discussions, and theorisations about the medium and its potential. For the first 4 months there were less than 50 members on the list, with an average of 300 messages sent each month. In December 2004 this jumped to over 1000 messages, which led the way into one of the most active years in the history of the community.</Content>

    <Content> On July 9th 2005, Adam Quirk, initiated and hosted the first ever Vloggercue (videoblogger BBQ) on his roof-top in Hoboken, New York. Adam had started videoblogging in 2004 when there were only a handful of people on the videoblogging list. An introvert, Adam had found it difficult to get to know people after he’d moved to the city with just his girlfriend and his cat, and videoblogging afforded him the chance to ‘have conversations with these other people online and experience some kind of socializing without having to resort to going to bars and meeting strangers face to face’. Vloggercue 2004 was attended by a small group of videobloggers, among them Jay Dedman, Steve Garfield, Bre Pettis (who started the website </Content>

    <Content>Although individuals had created personal webpages (home pages) for years, Pyra Lab’s launch of Blogger in 1999 contributed to changing how people interacted on the internet. Blogger was a publishing platform that allowed individuals without any previous skill to run their own blogs easily and free of charge. The term weblog was coined by John Barger in December 1997 whereas the more popular term ‘blog’ was coined by Peter Merholz in April/May 1999. The terms were used to signify a personal homepage that was distinctly different from a personal home page. Instead of a static web page with text, links and images, blogs are ‘web-based journals in which entries are displayed in reverse chronological sequence’.</Content>

    <Content> As early adopter and early weblogger Rebecca Blood points out, there have been personal websites that have subsequently been identified as ‘blogs’ since 1998. Initially, there were very few of these weblogs, which meant that – similarly to the early videoblogging community – the bloggers were all reading each others posts. With the launch of Blogger and what she calls the ‘post-Blogger explosion’ the nature of blogs changed. Whereas the early community of bloggers had been concerned with the ‘web at large’, the new bloggers treated their sites more like a diary and these blogs, which were often updated several times during the day, were ‘a record of the blogger’s thoughts: something noticed on the way to work, notes about the weekend, a quick reflection on some subject or another.’</Content>

    <Content>Similarly, danah boyd traces the development of the early blogging platforms, including Typepad, Diaryland and Live Journal as well as the evolution of the definition of blogging. Whereas most early theorisation of blogs attempted to define it as a genre of writing, boyd finds it more helpful to ‘reframe blogs as a culture-driven medium upon which the practice of blogging can occur’. She argues that within the context of communication, ‘a medium is the channel through which people can communicate or extend their expressions to others’ in a similar way that paper is the medium of writing. Drawing on McLuhan, boyd contends that a medium allows people to express themselves and asserts that ‘blogs are precisely this; they allow people to extend themselves into a networked digital environment that is often thought to be disembodying. The blog becomes both the digital body as well as the medium through which bloggers express themselves.’</Content>

    <Content>, Howe moves around in his London home, talking, more or less coherently, directly into his handheld camera, a Kodak dx7440, about his reactions to a terrorist attack. Rupert told me he was recommended that particular camera by Andreas Haugstrup Pedersen, another videoblogger on the email list, because he ‘liked the colour in his videos.’ This is interesting in relation to an already evident aesthetic consideration of videoblogging practice. At one point, the camera cuts to a map, trailing Howe’s finger to show how close he lives to the location of the attacks. The cuts are fast, and longer sequences have been trimmed to make the video snappier and flow better. After a sharply edited section in which he discusses his feelings about the attacks, Howe moves into the garden. Flooded in natural sunlight (he was shooting on this small, handheld camera, with no additional ‘production values’ such as lighting, sound or crew), he makes a short, but bold statement about how he will not leave London – instead he will take his sister and nephew to the park and spend a normal afternoon with them. As he puts it, ‘I guess… we’re not afraid’. </Content>

He was an amateur video-maker with a camera and an internet connection, talking about an event that was lacking a personal video side to the story. This was a format that was new and fresh and seemed to speak from the heart – giving it a personal, on-the-spot situational quality, which was magnified by the technical limitations of the medium of video.

    <Content> for three reasons. The first is personal. Although it was by no means the first video posted online, the video marked my own discovery of the use of video, as opposed to text, within the blog format. Despite having read (and written) blogs for a while, I had never before seen anyone use video to communicate through their website, and my reaction to Howe’s video was a mix of fascination and excitement. The intimacy channelled through the video (mostly close-ups of Howe’s face, with his home always in the background) seemed different to me to the mainly text-based blogs I was used to reading. I was inspired to watch other videos on his blog, and later, to follow the links in his sidebar to other videoblogs. From there, I discovered an entire community of videobloggers, and I was fascinated by the many videos, genres and topics covered, from the political to the personal, videos about families, children and cats, videos captured whilst the videoblogger was at work, walking down the street, or just rolling out of bed. It seemed to me to raise a number of interesting questions in terms of artistic expression, identity and community. On one level, therefore, </Content>

    <Content>Secondly, the story arc of Howe’s videoblog (initially small in scope and entirely personal, followed by massive attention from mainstream media, and eventual disappearance) is an example of the instabilities of videoblogging as media-form, especially in its early days. In this case, the cause was partially economic. Howe had to take the video offline because he could no longer afford to keep it online. This instability, in Howe’s case, wasn’t altogether positive, however. As a result of the feature in the </Content>

Before the days of free online video hosting, Howe was paying for his own traffic, and suddenly found himself in a situation where he owed his Internet Service Provider (ISP) large sums of money. As he told me, ‘The rate was something like £10 per additional 1GB, and the files would have been around 5-6mb per minute (at 750mbps) and around 3 mins - so say 18mb each. That means I would have maxed out my allowance with 555 views.

    <Content>Howe felt he was left with no option but to remove the entire site. However, videoblogs were unstable in other ways too. There was, for instance, no standard format that was used by all videobloggers. Whereas some preferred to encode their videos using Apple’s QuickTime, others relied on Windows’ media player or one of many Flash players available across the internet. Sites such as YouTube, Blip.tv, Vimeo and others all had different players, which would display videos in slightly different ways. For example, some players, like the Blip-embedded plug-in, allowed the viewer to navigate within the video being shown (by pausing, fast forwarding or stopping) but also browse through the entire archive of videos by the artist they were watching. In contrast, at the time, if a videoblogger used YouTube, the viewer could only access other videos at the end of the current one. Digital formats (or codecs) could easily change and/or became obsolete, sites were moved and links broken, and some formats (such as Flash) might play nicely on the web, but not on mobile devices (such as the video compatible iPod, and, later, the iPhone).</Content>

          <Content>Steve Job’s letter from April 2010 expands on Apple’s reasoning behind choosing to disallow Flash on the iPhone. Jobs explains that Apple is committed to open standards on the web, and that Flash is 100% a propriatory product owned by Adobe. Further, he points out that despite Adobe’s claims that because they refuse to use Flash, Apple customers cannot access what he calls the ‘full web,’ there are ‘over 50,000 games and entertainment titles on the App Store’ and ‘are more games and entertainment titles available for iPhone, iPod and iPad than for any other platform in the world.’ Jobs goes on to highlight the issues with reliability, security and performance associated with Flash and the lack of ability to use touch screen technology, before presenting a damning account of the way in which Flash drains the battery life of a device (‘The difference is striking: on an iPhone, for example, H.264 videos play for up to 10 hours, while videos decoded in software play for less than 5 hours before the battery is fully drained’). Lastly, and most importantly to Jobs, Apple’s decision to disallow Flash on the iPhone relates to the company’s refusal to allow what Jobs calls ‘a third-party layer of software’. As he argues, ‘If developers grow dependent on third party development libraries and tools, they can only take advantage of platform enhancements if and when the third party chooses to adopt the new features. We cannot be at the mercy of a third party deciding if and when they will make our enhancements available to our developers’ Apple, Thoughts on Flash, 2010, http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/</Content>

There was also awareness within the community of the inherent problems with attempting to make money, as Howe commented on the email list. ‘I would never pay $3 for a video to my phone,’ he asserted, ‘But then I watch all these people’s videos for free on my iPod every day.’ Most practitioners treated their videoblog as a personal diary, a visual archive of their lives, and argued that they would never dream of trying to make money from videos they saw as highly personal. After a particularly unpleasant exchange between a new member and the ‘core’ community around the buying and selling of domain names, Steve Watkins, an active member who would often write long considered replies to issues, stated bluntly that ‘business and money often get a bit of a rough ride here, as they do elsewhere on the net.

    <Content>So, for example, Jen Gouvea, who lived in San Francisco with her boyfriend Kent Bye, ran a website exploring the ‘internal and external approaches to social change and how the two are reciprocal.’ The pair had started videoblogging as a way to communicate, they made videos about ‘spiritual activism’ and used their online presence to promote spirituality and well-being. Gouvea had no previous camera experience, so she kept her videos simple with few edits. Having grown up without a lot of technology in her life and considering herself a ‘bit of an introvert’, Gouvea never posted videos about her everyday life, yet told me her videos were ‘sometimes almost too personal, to a point where it might only make sense to me and a few select initiated’. Some tried to find ways to use their videoblogging skills to generate income in tangential ways. For instance, another videoblogger, Adam Quirk, told me ‘I don't think videoblogging itself will ever pay the bills, but I think I can find ways to make money through other projects related to it, such as creating video ads for other companies, or selling products through our video blog’. These different approaches to videoblogging as a practice, as a medium, as a distribution network and through various moments of contestation and debate, were reflected in the debates over lack of a coherent and stable definition of videoblogs, especially in its early days.</Content>

Examples of Web 2.0 technologies include the move from static to dynamic webpages, the increase in user-generated content and the growth of social networks.

    <Content>Within the contours of this book, however, Web 2.0 was an important concept for three reasons. Firstly, the discourses and ‘hype’ surrounding the term were very important to the videoblogging community, and its sense of emerging identity and practice. The promise of dynamism and widened participation was important to the videoblogging project. The growth of YouTube meant more people started to understand and appreciate the work the videobloggers had been championing. Secondly, the technical advantages that the Web 2.0 technologies offered (such as seamless RSS syndication for instance) had an effect on the development of the videoblogging platform. Thirdly, Web 2.0 ironically heralded the beginning of the end for the videoblogging community. As the big Web 2.0 companies, such as YouTube, started to attract users, and Twitter and Facebook became the key social networks for communication, video and photo-sharing on the web, the videoblogging community began to breakdown. So, Web 2.0 is important as a symptom for understanding the problems videoblogging was facing at the time, whilst simultaneously signalling the beginning of its transformation from craft practice to being co-opted into industrialised global media systems.</Content>

The contribution of YouTube was to simplify the technical process of videoblogging, leading to a transformation of online video culture. This was a shift from the idea of the website as a personal storage facility for video content to a platform for public self-expression. It was also the beginning of a shift to a new political economy for video online, although few at the time realised this.</Content>

In contrast, the underlying internet protocols have affordances towards networked and decentralised ways of transferring information. Early commentators on the internet lauded it as an alternative distribution model, without the gatekeepers of ‘big media’, allowing anyone with access to it, the possibility of becoming an active member of the public sphere. However, as the debates around net neutrality show us, although the ‘old’ gatekeepers of the media are losing some of their power, there are new gatekeepers emerging that control both access to, and interactions within the web itself, be it Google, Amazon, Apple or Facebook.</Content>

    <Content> These factors were in danger of encouraging a ‘precautionary’ environment in relation to online video in particular. If users began to be worried about possible expensive legal issues from uploading a video with a snippet of background music or video, this would have chilled the growth of video usage in social media. The worry was not just that casual users might be caught up in dragnet copyright suits – but also political movements, activists and others might have copyright used to silence them. Indeed, new and innovative music, artists and video experimentation might also be inhibited. The use of the notion of a ‘safe harbour’ was crucial to these developments, but a side effect was that media sharing sites became (over)zealous in the removal of any content that could be considered to be copyright infringing.</Content>

    <Content>It is important to keep in mind that the internet today is very different from the internet in 2004. Although many of the issues that were raised and discussed in 2004 remain relevant today, the way in which they were debated and the concerns they prompted were experienced in a different milieu. This historical dimension is crucial for understanding media as I believe a comparative approach can be very powerful in relation to understanding the kind of media disjunction that videoblogging signified. Consequently, at this point I want to take a historical detour to think about previous iterations of film and video technology, and also how artists, filmmakers and theorists thought about these changes. The aim is to broaden the connections and to start to make links to the continuities and often explicit references videobloggers made to this previous history.</Content>

    <Content>Vertov’s influence on film has been widely discussed and remarked upon, but interestingly his work also consciously or unconsciously inspired the practice of videoblogging. Videobloggers followed one or more of Vertov’s elements in their work. Whether they explored everyday life, interactions with other videobloggers, stories with clear conventional narratives or more experimental videos, they told me their cameras – like the kino-eye – acted as an extension of their own eyes looking out on the world, catching life candidly and often blind to traditional cinematic conventions. Like Vertov, the videobloggers didn’t try to hide the camera, technology and tools they used as part of their practice. Instead, by making these elements part of the aesthetic itself, they added a specific Vertovian vernacular aesthetic to their work that has subsequently become recognisable.</Content>

Nonetheless, it is helpful to follow the call to start in the middle ‘from the entanglement of past and present’ and explore ‘the part-futures and future-pasts, as well as parallel side-lines of media archaeology.’</Content>

    <Content>To illustrate the way in which videoblogging sought continuities as well as contrasts with previous media forms, take the example of a discussion on the videoblogging email list in November 2009. Here, Rupert Howe made a point that a video he had watched that morning ‘however pretentious you may think this sounds… really [is] carrying forward and reinventing the tradition of observational documentary filmmaking that can be traced back through Direct Cinema, Cinema Verité and Kino Pravda all the way to the Lumiére brothers’ first films’. This was not the only comment of its kind to be made on the email list. The other members often brought up cinematic styles or theories – drawing comparisons with videoblogging or recognising the debt their practice owed to video and film pioneers of the past. For instance, as commented by Adrian Miles on the email list in February 2005, there were clear attempts made to position videoblogging in a wider history of film and cinema. As he argued;</Content>

    <Content>Here it is worth mentioning Steve Neale’s approach to cinema, which is important for the way he bridges two separate schools of thought in cinema history; the first in which film technology is treated as ‘a self-contained sphere with a self-contained history’, a chronological account in which ‘each new feature or process either displaces those already in existence or else simply adds to them, increasing the stock of technical resources available’; the second being completely engrossed with the concept of realism and the indexical which ‘works from the premise that the sounds and images comprising films are linked ontologically to the objects that the microphone and camera record’. Neale draws on the theories of Bazin and Kracauer, which explore a contradictory and troubled relationship with technology. Here, the advances in technology allow for more realistic cinema, yet this increased use of technology leads to it’s complete disappearance, with representation and technology being repressed, along with the film industry itself. Neale develops a ‘counter-approach’ by locating technological innovation within aesthetic, ideological and economic, scientific and technical contexts, all of which exist within the broad umbrella of the film industry.</Content>

Although I don’t have much space to discuss his work in much detail here, some of the mentions on the list included this thought experiment from Adrian Miles; ‘there is no art without constraint. Bandwidth, screen size, user time and network stutter are constraints (Thought experiment, if Godard started his career as videoblogger, what do you think he’d be doing?)’. Robert Croma, who made short artistic pieces pushing digital effects to their limits, invoked Godard in a debate about the whether videoblogging should follow cinematic conventions; ‘To me there’s a large element of YAWN to the strictures and suggestions being proffered here… How very very dull it all becomes when you tell people this is how you should do it if it’s to be done ‘correctly’. So terribly boring. ‘Watch those eyelines.’ ‘Don't shoot from below.’ And definitely no jump cuts. Godard must be vomiting as we speak...

    <Content>, another cinematic metaphor frequently referred to on the videoblogging email list. Miles, for instance, remarked that ‘a camera in your phone is pretty much Astruc’s Camera Stylo isn’t it?’ For Astruc, the camera follows the tradition of the literary, where ‘the idea of the camera as a tool to write with – indeed twice over, first when you shoot and then when you write the film on the timeline’ is in focus.</Content>

As Astruc argued, ‘new age of the cinema [is] the age of caméra-styló (camera-pen)… the cinema will gradually break free from the tyranny of what is visual, from the image for its own sake, from the immediate and concrete demands of the narrative, to become a means of writing just as flexible and subtle as written language.</Content>

Astruc further argued that ‘with the development of 16mm and television, the day is not far off when everyone will possess a projector, will go to the local bookstore and hire films written on any subject, of any form, from literary criticism and novels to mathematics, history, and general science.’</Content>

    <Content> Medvedkin and his team would stay in one place for a few days, make a film and screen it in that same location. This meant that the feedback loop from conception to completion was very tight and that the intended audience were also the subjects of the films. The group’s motto was ‘film today and show it tomorrow,’ an idea that is echoed in later film and video work. This fast production-line system of capturing, producing and displaying film was revolutionary, and, years later would inspire French film maker Chris Marker to experiment with a similar process, when he worked with the factory workers in Besançon. The ultimate aim of Medvedkin and his contemporaries was to ‘hold up a transformative and coercive mirror to the people, to show them the facts of their daily existence, which, once reflected back to them, would provoke them to take their lives into their own hands and </Content>

For instance, at Vloggercon 2005 – the first videoblogging conference to move beyond the videobloggers own homes and incorporate representatives from various start-ups and community groups – the organisers would film panels all day and spend the nights editing and uploading video so that those unable to attend would be able to take part in the conversations as soon as possible. The fast turn-around of videoblogging – most people I talked to would publish their videos within a week of shooting – echoes Medvedkin’s attempt to close the loop between filming and viewing, and is something that digital filming and editing made easier.</Content>

    <Content>There were also videobloggers who used their practice as a way to both engage with political issues, and indeed take political action. In particular, the videoblogger Josh Wolf, who was arrested, and later sentenced to prison, for refusing to testify before a U.S. grand jury. When arrested, Wolf also failed to hand over unpublished video footage he shot during a raucous clash on the streets between San Francisco police officers and anti-G8 protesters in July 2005. The incident was interesting because it challenged the relationship between the videobloggers and the media. Like many a videoblogger at the time, Wolf employed a discourse that was often scornful of corporate-controlled media. He was freed on April 3rd 2007, after seven and a half months in prison, when his lawyers reached a compromise with the federal prosecutors. He eventually handed over the tapes, but was excused from identifying any of the individuals that featured on the video. He famously appeared on </Content>

    <Content>I now want to zoom in on another important background for thinking about videoblogging, namely the creation of home-movies. This is a practice that can be traced back to the end of the 1890s. As an aesthetic, it highlighted domesticity situated within particular cultural contexts, allowing people to curate mediated versions of their own lives that encouraged new ways of seeing the present and shaping their collective memory. Through this form, people ‘negotiated their relationship with their surroundings and sense of self’.</Content>

Whereas Marker, and Medvedkin, Vertov and Astruc had worked hard to utilise film in their art for political critique and change, the emergence of video gave rise to a new set of practices made possible by the more flexible medium of videotape. Ina Blom persuasively argues that video ‘propels artists to take media power in their own hands, using televisual techniques for the non-instrumentalist purposes of art’.</Content>

Shamberg wanted to disrupt the media ecology of ‘Media America’, to empower individuals to actively take part in their own media environment, because, following McLuhan, he believed that ‘media and man evolve together’, and that video represented the most important cultural technology of our time, as it ‘frees film to become an art form’.</Content>

Having to operate within a corporate framework and to the network’s deadlines caused an enormous amount of friction within the group, and Boyle tracks how the community slowly grew apart. The rhetoric of the TVTV collective, and the Guerrilla television movement more generally might seem out-dated today, but their aim of utilising new video technologies to challenge the entire informational infrastructure of the media landscape, remains not only timely, but pertinent. In many ways, the digital video activisms we see today – and which was pioneered by the early adopters of online video – can be seen as the ‘fulfilment of a radical 1960s dream of making “people’s television”.’</Content>

Whereas film is an expensive medium, video made it cheap and displaying it was easier. This, in conjunction with activist movement of the time, led to the creation of specific events, like the New York Women’s Video Festival which ran between 1972 and 1980. This festival linked portable video, the women’s movement, and the emergence of new cultural practices and new spaces for political contestation. For many women, creating video became a unique means of self-expressions (this is also the argument put forward by Alexandra Juhasz in her work on YouTube).</Content>

    <Content> Renov argues that after the political storm of the 1970s, which the Guerrilla TV and the feminist movements had both been part of, the period after became rather more interested in the ‘mundane’. Renov also points out how, in this later period, the documentary tradition moved away from an ‘informed’ and ‘objective’ style to a more individualistic perspective. Norris Nicholson makes a similar argument, when she states that ‘early amateur film is one way of tapping into people’s memories about themselves and how they relate to others in contrasting contexts’.</Content>
